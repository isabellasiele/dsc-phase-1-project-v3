    "# Aviation Accident Risk Analysis\n",
    "## 1.Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The company is planning to expand into the aviation industry to diversify its portfolio. The idea is to purchase and operate aircraft for commercial and private use. The project will thus use data to provide insights and guide on decisions to make by cleaning, analysing and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The company does not have much information on aviation safety or accident patterns. This may expose the business to unnecessary risks like financial losses and safety concerns.Thus the  project aims to determine which aircraft has the lowest risk for the company to start this new business and what factors to consider which influence the occurence of accidents. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will focus on answering three main questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Which aircraft make and categories have the lowest accident and fatality rates?It helps to identify safe aircraft types to prioritize during purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "-What outside factors(Weather conditions)play the biggest role  in accidents?\n",
    "\n",
    "-How does the purpose of flight(commercial)affect accident risks?\n",
    "\n"

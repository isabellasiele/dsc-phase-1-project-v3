# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The company  is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio specifically in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises.This project seeks to identify aircraft models that offer the lowest operational and safety risks, thereby supporting long-term reliability and cost efficiency. Through analysis of industry data, the aim is to provide actionable insights and clear recommendations. These findings will equip the aviation division with the critical information needed to make informed, risk-conscious purchasing decisions.

# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Investing in aircraft represents a substantial commitment with far-reaching implications for operational continuity, safety, and financial sustainability. Inaccurate or poorly informed decisions in aircraft selection can result in elevated maintenance costs, increased safety risks, regulatory issues, and diminished customer trust.

This project addresses these concerns by conducting a data-driven evaluation of aircraft risk profiles. Key assessment areas will be history of accidents, the manufacturers of aircrafts and purpose of flight. By identifying aircraft with consistently strong performance and low risk, the company can safeguard its investment, optimize fleet operations, and establish a solid foundation for success in the aviation sector.

# DATA UNDERSTANDING AND ANALYSIS
The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from kaggle datasets(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drealbash/aviation-accident-from-1919-2023?select=aviation-accident-data-2023-05-16.csv). It provides a comprehensive record of aircraft accidents between the years 1919 and 2023.

This dataset is in CSV (comma-separated values) format, where each line represents a unique incident or accident, and the first row defines the column headers. It contains 90,348 records across 31 columns. While the dataset is rich in information, it includes a significant amount of missing data, which necessitates careful preprocessing before analysis.

Key attributes relevant to our analysis include:
- The event ID
- Make and model
- Number of fatal injuries.

To ensure that the data was not misleading and relevant some steps was perfomed. This was removing columns with very many missing values and standardizing the datatypes.
Visualizations were done to show the findings,they included the make,purpose of flight ,phase of flight,years, against the number of accidents and fatality rate.

To explore the findings in greater detail, the full interactive Tableau dashboard is available for review. The dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of  flight phase risk distribution and other key insights derived from the dataset.[here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/isabellah.chelangat/viz/Aircraftriskdashboard_17593309275170/AIRCRAFTRISKDASHBOARD?publish=yes]


# Conclusion
Certain aircraft models consistently show low accident rate and fatality rate.

Most accidents occur during takeoff and landing.

The number of accidents have progressively decreased over the years.
